## Description

This project is a product return system, where users can register a return of a product. The project is built with a frontend and backend, where the frontend is built with View and the backend is built with Node.js. The project uses a NoSQL database to store data.

The website is divided into two main parts: the user part and the admin part. The user part is where users can register a return of a product. The admin part is where the admin can see all the returns that have been registered. Additional functionality includes:

- The ability to add new users and delete users.
- The ability to add new returns and delete returns.
- The ability to see all the returns that have been registered and filter based on parameters.
- Send automatic emails to users when a return has been registered.
- Create nodes related to return cases.

### Motivation

This project was created as a side project while studying economics at UIT Alta. The main motivation behind creating the project was educational aspects. As a newbie, who had never programmed anything of relevance before, this project was a great start for learning about backend, front-end and general project management.
